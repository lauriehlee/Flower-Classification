To run the knn Algorithm:
- In the terminal, go to location of knnAlgorithm.py & iris.csv (should be in same folder)
- Enter command in terminal: python3 knnAlgorithm.py iris.csv
- This will: 
    Pop up window of plot depicting value of k vs accuracy for both predicting training & testing sets


To run the decision tree algorithm:
- In the terminal, go to location of decisionTreeAlgorithm.py & house_votes_84.csv (should be in same folder)
- Enter command in terminal: python3 decisionTreeAlgorithm.py house_votes_84.csv
- This will:
    Print out average accuracy from predicting training set 100 times
    Print out standard deviation from predicting training set 100 times
    Print out average accuracy from predicting testing set 100 times
    Print out standard deviation from predicting testing set 100 times
    Pop up window of the histogram depicting accuracy vs frequency for both predicting training & testing sets
